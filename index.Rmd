title: 'Spatial Thoughts OpenCourseWare'
---

We offer a range of courses to enable learners across the globe upgrade their skills. We have made all the course material available under an open license that allows anyone to self-study and work through the exercises. 

---

These courses are also offered as online instructor-led classes. The online instructor-led classes cover these materials in much more depth - with discussion, Q&A and support - to enable you to learn the nuances and apply these skills to your own spatial analysis problems. We are also a QGIS.org certifying organization and offer high-quality affordable programs to earn globally recognized official QGIS.org certification. Visit the [Courses Homepage](https://spatialthoughts.com/courses/) to learn more.
