# Introduction 

This class covers Python from the very basics. Suitable for GIS practitioners with no programming background or python knowledge. The course will introduce participants to basic programming concepts, libraries for spatial analysis, geospatial APIs and techniques for building spatial data processing pipelines.

# Get the Data Package
The code examples in this class use a variety of datasets. All the required datasets are supplied to you in the ``python_foundation.zip`` with your purchase. Unzip this file to the `Downloads` directory. All code examples assume the data is available in the ``<home folder>/Downloads/python_foundation/`` directory. 

# Installation and Setting up the Environment

There are many ways to install Python on your system. Many operating systems comes with a Python distribution built-in too. If you use software such as QGIS - it comes with its own version of Python. Working on Python projects typically require installing third-party packages (i.e. tools). As these packages have different dependencies - they often cause conflicts and errors due to different versions of Python on your system. 

An easy and reliable way to get a Python installation on your system is via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). For this course, we will use the Anaconda3 Individual Edition to install Python and required spatial analysis packages.

> Many Python tool names have references to the reptile world. The default Python package manager is called [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) which references the process of hatching eggs. Interestingly, the naming of the Python language itself had [nothing to do with reptiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum#Python).

1. [Download the Anaconda Installer](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) for Python 3.7 for your operating system. Once downloaded, double click the installer and install it into the default suggested directory. Select an install for *Just Me* and use default settings.

> Note: Install Anaconda to a directory path that does not contain spaces or unicode characters.

  ```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
  knitr::include_graphics('images/python_foundation/conda1.png')
  ```

2. Once installed, launch the *Anaconda Navigator* program. It is a good practice to create a new *environment* for each of your Python projects. An environment is a space where you will install required packages. Many packages may contain conflicting requirements which could prevent them all being installed into a single environment. Having a separate environment isolates your project from such problems. Click on the *Environments* tab.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/python_foundation/conda2.png')
```

3. Click the *+ Create* button and name the environment as ``python_foundation``. Click *Create*.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/python_foundation/conda3.png')
```

4. Once created, click the *Channels* button. A channel is a repository where packages are hosted. The default channel is good for most purposes. But some packages we require for this class are not available in the default channel, so we need to add another channel. In the *Manage channels* dialog, click *Add* and enter ``conda-forge``. Press *Enter*.

> Learn more about [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/introduction.html) 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/python_foundation/conda4.png')
```

5. Click the *Update Channels* button.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/python_foundation/conda5.png')
```

6. Once the update is done, search for the package ``geopandas``. This is a package that allows you to work with vector geospatial data in Python. Select the check-box next to the first result and click *Apply* to install the package with all its dependencies.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/python_foundation/conda6.png')
```

7. Similarly, search and install the following packages

- ``geopy``
- ``rasterio``
- ``matplotlib``

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/python_foundation/conda7.png')
```

8. Switch to the *Home* tab. Ensure that you have the *python_foundation* environment selected. We will now install some programs which allow us to write and execute Python scripts. From the home screen, install the ``JupyterLab`` and ``CMD.exe prompt`` applications. (Mac and Linux users can skip the CMD.exe prompt install).

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/python_foundation/conda8.png')
```

9. After the installation completes, click *Launch* button for the *JupyterLab* application. JupyterLab is a web application that allows you to write, document and run Python code. It allow you to interactively run small bits of code and see the results. It also support a variety of output formats such as charts or maps - making it an ideal platform for data science projects. We will be using Jupyter notebooks for all exercises in this course.

> The name Jupyter comes from the 3 primary programming languages it supports - Julia, Python and R.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/python_foundation/conda9.png')
```

10. A new browser tab will open with an instance of JupterLab. Click the *Python 3*  button under *Notebooks*.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/python_foundation/conda10.png')
```

11. Enter the following statements in the first cell and click the *Run* button. **If nothing happens - it means your installation was successful!**. If you get an *ImportError*, repeat the installation steps carefully again.

```
import geopandas
import geopy
import rasterio
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/python_foundation/conda11.png')
```

# Using Jupyter Notebooks

Your class data package contain multiple Jupyter notebooks containing code and exercises for this class. 

1. Launch the *Anaconda Navigator* program. Ensure that you have the *python_foundation* environment selected. click *Launch* button for the *JupyterLab* application. It will open your Web Browser and load the application in a new tab. From the left-hand panel, navigate to the directory where you extracted the data package.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/python_foundation/setup1.png')
```

2. Jupyter notebooks have a `.ipynb` extensions. Double-click on a notebook file to open it.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/python_foundation/setup2.png')
```

# Writing Standalone Python Scripts

So far we have used Jupyter Notebooks to write and execute Python code. A notebook is a great choice to interactively explore, visualize and document workflows. But they are not suited for writing scripts for automation. If you have tasks that are long running or want to execute certain tasks on a schedule, you have to write scripts in a standalone `.py` file and run it from a Terminal or Console.

## Get a Text Editor

Any kind of software development requires a good text editor. If you already have a favorite text editor or an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), you may use it for this course. Otherwise, each platform offers a wide variety of free or paid options for text editors. Choose the one that fits your needs.

Below are my recommendations editors that are simple to use for beginners.

- Windows: [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) is a good free editor for windows. Download and install the Notepad++ editor. Tip: Before writing Python code in Notepad+++, make sure to go to Settings &rarr; Preferences &rarr; Tab Settings and enable `Replace by space`. Python is very sensitive about whitespace and this setting will ensure tabs and spaces are treated properly.
- Mac: [TextMate](https://macromates.com/) is an open-source editor for Mac that is currently available for free.

## Writing a Script

Copy the following code and paste it in your text editor. Browse to the data package directory and save the file as `get_distance.py`. Make sure that there is no `.txt` extension at the end. 

```{python eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/python_foundation/get_distance.py')}
```

## Executing a Script

### Windows

1. Launch the *Anaconda Navigator* program. Select the `python_foundation` environment and launch the `CMD.exe` program.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script using the `cd` command.

```
cd Downloads\python_foundation
```
3. Run the script using the `python` command. The script will run and print the distance.

```
python get_distance.py
```

### Mac and Linux

1. Open a Terminal Window.

2. Switch to the correct conda environment. 

```
conda activate python_foundation
```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the script using the `cd` command.

```
cd Downloads/python_foundation
```

3. Run the script using the `python` command. The script will run and print the distance.

> If you have multiple python installations on your system, you will have to pick the right Python binary. If the command fails, try `python3.7` instead of just `python` in the command below. The script will run and print the distance.

```
python get_distance.py
```
