# Introduction 

Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based platform that enables large-scale processing of satellite imagery to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earthâ€™s surface. This course covers the full range of topics in Earth Engine to give the participants practical skills to master the platform and implement their remote sensing projects.


# Setting up the Environment

## Sign-up for Google Earth Engine

If you already have a Google Earth Engine account, you can skip this step.

Visit [https://signup.earthengine.google.com/](https://signup.earthengine.google.com/){target="_blank"} and sign-up with your Google account. You can use your existing gmail account to sign-up. It usually takes a 1-2 days for approval. Hence do this step as soon as possible.

Tips to ensure smooth sign-up process:

- Use Google Chrome browser.
- When signing up for Earth Engine, please log out of all Google accounts and ensure you are logged into only 1 account which you want associated with Earth Engine. 
- Access to Google Earth Engine is granted via Google Groups. The default settings should be fine, but verify you have the correct setting enabled.
    - Visit [groups.google.com](http://groups.google.com/){target="_blank"}
    - Click on Settings (gear icon) and select Global Settings.
    - Make sure the option Allow group managers to add me to their groups is checked.

## Complete the Class Pre-Work

This class needs about 2-hours of pre-work. Please watch the following videos to get a good understanding of remote sensing and how Earth Engine works. Videos are available online and can be streamed using video links below. 

### Introduction to Remote Sensing

This video introduces the remote sensing concepts, terminology and techniques.

### Introduction to Google Earth Engine

This video gives a broad overview of Google Earth Engine with selected case studies and application. The video also covers the Earth Engine architecture and how it is different than traditional remote sensing software.

### Take the Quiz

After you watch the videos, please [take this quiz](https://forms.gle/BoaYhMgpjwNn3amS8){target="_blank"}.

## Get the Course Materials

The course material and exercises are in the form of Earth Engine scripts shared via a code repository.

1. [Click this link](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/ujavalgandhi/End-to-End-GEE) to open Google Earth Engine code editor and add the repository to your account.
2. If successful, you will have a new repository named `users/ujavalgandhi/End-to-End-GEE` in the *Scripts* tab in the *Reader* section.
3. Verify that your code editor looks like below

# Module 1: Earth Engine Basics

## Hello World

This script introduces the basic Javascript syntax. To learn more, visit [Introduction to JavaScript for Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/tutorial_js_01) section of the Earth Engine User Guide. 

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/01-Earth-Engine-Basics/01b_Hello_World_(complete)')}
```

### Exercise

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/01-Earth-Engine-Basics/01c_Hello_World_(exercise)')}
```

## Working with Image Collections

Most datasets in Earth Engine come as a `ImageCollection`. An ImageCollection is a dataset that consists of images takes at different time and locations - usually from the same satellite or data provider. You can load a collection by searching the [Earth Engine Data Catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets) for the *ImageCollection ID*. Search for the *Sentinel-2 Level 1C* dataset and you will find its id `COPERNICUS/S2_SR`.

Before you do anything with the collection, it is useful to see information about a single image contained in the collection. The `first()` function extracts the first image in the collection. You can then `print()` the result to see the bands and metadata contained in that image.

To see the collection on a map, we need to use `Map.addLayer()` function. But before that we need to know some parameters. The Earth Engine data catalog provides suggested visualization parameters for all collections. Visit the [Sentinel-2, Level 1C page](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S2) and see *Explore in Earth Engine* section to find the visualization parameters. We can use these to add the collection to the map.


```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/01-Earth-Engine-Basics/02b_Image_Collections_(complete)')}
```

### Exercise

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/01-Earth-Engine-Basics/02c_Image_Collections_(exercise)')}
```

## Filtering Image Collections

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/01-Earth-Engine-Basics/03b_Filtering_Image_Collection_(complete)')}
```

### Exercise

```{js eval=FALSE, code=readLines('code/end_to_end_gee/01-Earth-Engine-Basics/03c_Filtering_Image_Collection_(exercise)')}
